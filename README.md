# Alpaca image generator website

This is an open source project from [DevProjects](https://www.codementor.io/projects/web/alpaca-image-generator-website-ce2oc0eus8). This project is not just about alpacas. Allowing users to generate and download avatars are common in many interactive websites. In this project, I learnt how to create an image generator website that allows users to generate, combine, and download images.
